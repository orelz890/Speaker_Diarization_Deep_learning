# 🎙 Enhanced Speaker Diarisation with OSD, SS, and Improved Methods 📊🗣️

Welcome to the **Enhanced Speaker Diarisation** project repository! This project is an evolution of the [original VBx diarisation approach](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/VBx) developed by **Brno University of Technology**. 

In addition to incorporating Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD) and Source Separation (SS), this project explores various enhancements like the Linkage method, the Knee Locator, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). While some avenues didn't lead to the desired improvements, this repository serves as a valuable experiment and a platform for potential future advancements.

## 🛠️ About Enhanced Methods and Techniques 

### Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD) 👥🔊
We integrated an Overlapped Speech Detection module into our diarisation pipeline. The OSD module, powered by the `osd_detection.py` script, enabled us to identify segments within conversations where multiple speakers are talking simultaneously. By marking these instances, we were able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of speaker interactions.

### Source Separation (SS) 🧩🎤
Another pivotal addition was the implementation of Source Separation using the `source_separation.py` script. This enhancement tackled the complexity of overlapping speech segments. By disentangling these segments and segregating them into individual speaker recordings, we laid the groundwork for more precise speaker identification.

### Linkage Method (Average) 🧬🧮
Our project incorporated an Average Linkage method for hierarchical clustering. Applied to the x-vector data, this technique contributed to the creation of clusters that effectively grouped together segments with similar characteristics. This consolidation of similar segments improved the accuracy of our speaker identification process.

### Knee Locator and PCA 🔍📈
As part of our exploration, we also experimented with advanced techniques such as the Knee Locator and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). While these methodologies did not lead to the anticipated enhancements in this iteration, they exemplified our commitment to pushing the boundaries of speaker diarisation methodologies.

## 🚀 Challenges Faced and Future Directions 

### Source Separation Enhancement 💡🎯
The project acknowledges the need for further refinement in the Source Separation step. Exploring advanced algorithms and techniques for separating overlapping speech segments could significantly enhance the accuracy of the diarisation process.

### Accurate Voice Activity Detection (VAD) 🔊🎚️
Enhancing the VAD module remains a priority. Utilizing state-of-the-art VAD algorithms or fine-tuning existing ones can contribute to the accurate identification of speech segments, a fundamental component of speaker diarisation.

### Real-time Diarisation ⏱️🌐
As an exciting future prospect, the project envisions extending its capabilities beyond recorded files to real-time diarisation. This expansion could have applications in live meetings, conferences, and various interactive scenarios.

### Additional Speaker Attributes 👤📊
Incorporating identification of additional speaker attributes such as gender, age, and emotional tone opens doors to rich statistical analyses and insights into conversations.





## 📸 Project Visuals

To provide you with a clearer understanding of our enhanced speaker diarisation project, we've included some visuals below:

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in Action
![VAD Example](/pics/VAD.png)

Before any diarisation process takes place, the VAD module identifies segments of speech within an audio recording, which are crucial for subsequent analysis.

### Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD) Example
![OSD Example](/pics/OSD.png)

In this example, the OSD module identifies overlapping segments within a conversation, helping to pinpoint instances where multiple speakers are talking simultaneously.

### Source Separation (SS) Demonstration

The SS enhancement untangles overlapping speech segments and separates them into distinct speaker recordings and outputs a new .lab file, improving the accuracy of speaker identification. 




## 📊 Results

We're excited to present the tangible improvements achieved through our enhanced speaker diarisation approach. Below, you'll find a comparison of the new and improved RTTM files generated by our methods, showcasing the advancements over the previous project's results.

### RTTM Comparison

**Key Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Speaker Boundaries:** Our OSD and SS modules contributed to more accurate identification of speaker boundaries, leading to reduced errors in segment start and end times.
- **Reduced Overlaps:** Overlapped speech segments are effectively separated, resulting in clearer and less cluttered speaker interactions.
- **Refined Speaker Labels:** The clustering enhancements, including the Linkage method, led to more coherent and consistent speaker labels in the RTTM file.

We encourage you to explore the provided RTTM files to witness the impact of our enhancements on speaker diarisation accuracy and quality.
